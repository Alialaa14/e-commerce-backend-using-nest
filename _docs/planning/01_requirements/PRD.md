# FashionConnect — Project Documentation

## Phase 1: Project Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

FashionConnect is a multi-role e-commerce and fulfillment platform designed for the Egyptian market with a strong emphasis on local payment behaviors, delivery logistics, trust, and operational control. The platform serves three core business constituencies:

- End-users who browse products, place orders, track deliveries, and interact with brands.
- Brands that manage catalogues, inventory, fulfillment, advertising, and payouts.
- Operational partners such as delivery companies and couriers that execute last-mile delivery and reconciliation.

The business model is a marketplace-style platform where brands sell through FashionConnect, the platform handles discovery, payments, order orchestration, delivery handoff, dispute handling, and admin governance. The platform must support both digital payments and cash-on-delivery (COD), which is a core requirement in the Egyptian market. This requirement materially affects the architecture, especially for payments, reconciliation, fraud prevention, and operational workflows.

The documentation provided here is intended to be the single source of truth for product, engineering, QA, DevOps, design, and business stakeholders. It aligns the business rationale from the supplied BA spec with the implemented data model and API design direction.

### Product Positioning

FashionConnect is not a simple storefront platform. It is a marketplace operating system that combines:

- Commerce transactions
- Brand verification and trust management
- Delivery orchestration
- Payment routing and settlement
- Admin governance and moderation
- Notification and communication flows

### Strategic Intent

The platform is designed to reduce friction across the complete commerce lifecycle:

1. Brand onboarding and verification
2. Product discovery and purchase
3. Order fulfillment
4. Delivery execution
5. Customer support and dispute resolution
6. Financial reconciliation and payout oversight

### Architectural Direction

The supplied schema and API direction indicate a modular SaaS architecture using:

- RESTful APIs
- Role-based authentication and authorization
- PostgreSQL as the primary transactional data store
- Background jobs for ranking, notifications, reporting, reconciliation, and moderation
- Event-driven integration points for payments and delivery

---

## 2. Business Goals

### Primary Business Goals

1. Create a trusted fashion marketplace that supports local market realities.
2. Enable brands to onboard quickly, manage products, and receive payouts through a governed process.
3. Increase conversion by supporting payment methods that are culturally and commercially relevant, especially COD and local wallet-based methods.
4. Improve customer confidence through verified brands, reviews, chat support, order tracking, and dispute handling.
5. Reduce operational losses from failed deliveries and payment disputes.
6. Create a scalable platform foundation capable of supporting future growth features such as loyalty, referrals, subscriptions, and analytics.

### Business Outcomes

- Increase GMV through improved conversion and retention
- Improve trust and reduce return-related losses
- Reduce operational friction between brands, customers, and delivery companies
- Enable admin oversight over payments, brand verification, rankings, and disputes
- Create a platform that can expand into more advanced commerce capabilities over time

### Product Outcomes

- Short onboarding cycle for trusted brands
- Self-serve catalog management for brands
- Fast, reliable checkout experience for end-users
- Transparent order lifecycle for all stakeholders
- Centralized moderation and dispute handling

---

## 3. Problem Statement

FashionConnect addresses a fundamental problem in modern fashion commerce in Egypt: customers want a trustworthy digital marketplace, but the market requires a solution that respects local realities such as COD, mobile-first behavior, Arabic/English bilingual expectations, and regional delivery constraints.

Without a strong platform, several business and operational risks arise:

- Brands struggle to gain visibility and trust in a fragmented market.
- Customers may be pushed to off-platform channels such as Instagram, WhatsApp, or direct phone sales.
- Merchants may experience high operational friction due to manual order handling and fragmented fulfillment.
- Delivery failures and unpaid COD obligations can create serious financial loss and customer dissatisfaction.
- Admin and operations teams lack centralized oversight over disputes, payouts, ranking, and moderation.

The platform must therefore serve as both a commerce layer and an operational control layer.

## 6. Business Rules

### Authentication and Identity

- All protected endpoints require authentication.
- Authentication is based on Bearer tokens and JWT-style access tokens.
- OTP verification is required for critical onboarding and checkout-related authentication flows.
- Refresh tokens must be revocable and device-scoped.

### Brand Verification

- Brands progress through verification tiers: pending, basic_verified, trusted_verified, and suspended.
- Trusted verification unlocks enhanced platform privileges, including improved ranking and lower commissions where defined.
- Brand documents must be reviewed before a brand becomes fully eligible for advanced functionality.

### Catalog and Product Management

- Categories may be deleted only through soft-delete or reassignment logic to preserve historical integrity.
- Product deletion must preserve references in historical orders and review data.
- Variant uniqueness is enforced at the product level for size/color combinations.

### Orders and Checkout

- Checkout creates one order-level record and one sub-order per brand in the cart.
- Delivery fees are calculated per sub-order based on brand origin and customer governorate.
- COD is a first-class payment mode and must be reconciled as a financial workflow.

### Delivery and Fulfillment

- Brand handoff triggers delivery company intake.
- Delivery status transitions must be auditable and tied to proof-of-delivery or OTP confirmation.
- COD collection and remittance are critical operational and financial workflows.

### Payments and Payouts

- Financial data must be append-only and auditable.
- Payout approval must follow an authorization workflow and should support dual authorization above a configured threshold.
- Wallets and brand balances are derived from ledger data and should not be treated as source-of-truth transaction records.

### Trust, Safety, and Moderation

- Chat abuse, product issues, and order disputes must feed a central queue.
- Admin moderation actions must be logged.
- Reviews feed ranking and vendor trust scoring.

## Open Issues and Clarifications Required Before Phase 2

The following items require confirmation before the next phase is produced, because they affect implementation scope and architecture:

1. The supplied SQL schema contains syntax errors and placeholders that must be corrected before implementation. Examples include:
   - `isBanned:` in the users table
   - `payment_details ?` in the brands table
   - references to `delivery_companies` and `couriers` from `sub_orders` before those tables are declared

2. The platform’s exact deployment model should be confirmed:
   - Monolith or modular services?
   - REST-only or hybrid with GraphQL?
   - Event bus and queueing platform desired?

3. The expected identity model should be confirmed:
   - Should user routes use token-based identity exclusively, or should path parameters such as `/users/{userId}` remain normative for internal use?

4. The product scope for Phase 2 should be confirmed:
   - Is the initial release intended to cover the full roadmap or only MVP scope?

5. The admin and sub-admin role model should be finalized:
   - Are there fixed permission scopes or a dynamic permission system?

Once these points are approved, I will proceed with Phase 2 and expand the documentation into full functional requirements for every module.

## 5. Architectural Decisions (From /grill-me Sessions)

### 5.1 Database Schema Architecture
- **Authentication:** Central Account table for auth, with 1-to-1 links to separate CustomerProfile, BrandProfile, and CourierProfile tables.
- **Multi-Brand Orders:** A parent OrderGroup represents the checkout session. It splits into separate Order records (one per brand) so they can fulfill independently.
- **Financial Ledger (COD):** An immutable, double-entry LedgerTransaction table handles all COD collections and payouts. Balances are never updated without a ledger row.
- **Inventory Locking:** We use Row-Level Locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) at checkout submission to prevent overselling highly anticipated drops.
